# Data Analysis project using SQL and Tableau

## Objective:
The primary goal of this project was to create a data analysis pipeline using SQL and Tableau, from data creation and population in MySQL, to data visualization in Tableau. The project demonstrates the integration of SQL for backend data management and Tableau for dynamic and interactive data visualization.


Here's a view of the dynamic dashboard created for analysis. Please click on it to view in Tabealu Public.

## Key Steps in the Project:

### 1. Dataset Creation and Management with MySQL:
- **Table Creation**: Used SQL to design the schema and create tables according to the data structure needed for analysis.
- **Data Population**: Populated the tables with sample data to simulate a real-world dataset.
- **Data Extraction**: Extracted data from the SQL database using queries to generate meaningful results, which would later be analyzed and visualized.

### 2. Data Export to Excel:
- Exported the table structure and data from MySQL to Excel, ensuring compatibility for the subsequent import into Tableau.
- Excel was used as an intermediary tool to check data integrity and structure before visualizing it in Tableau.

### 3. Data Import into Tableau:
- Imported the Excel file containing the dataset into Tableau, ensuring that the data was clean and structured appropriately for analysis.
- Defined connections and data sources in Tableau to enable smooth interaction between the data and the visualization.

### 4. Dashboard Creation in Tableau:
- Created a dynamic and interactive dashboard by choosing appropriate visualizations (charts, graphs, tables, etc.) to represent key data insights.
- Focused on user-friendly design principles to ensure the dashboard could be easily navigated by end-users.
- **Dynamic Content**: Integrated dropdown filters that allow users to select different values, dynamically changing the displayed content and enabling a customized view of the data.

### 5. Publishing the Dashboard on Tableau Public:
- Published the dashboard on Tableau Public, allowing the project to be shared and accessed by others online.
- This enabled me to showcase the dashboard's functionality and share the analysis with a broader audience.

## Skills Acquired and Learning Outcomes:

### 1. SQL Skills:
- Learned how to structure databases, define relationships, and implement data integrity constraints.
- Developed the ability to write queries for extracting meaningful insights from raw data.

### 2. Excel Integration:
- Became comfortable with using Excel as a tool for intermediate data storage and cleaning before visualizing in Tableau.
- Learned how to format and structure data in Excel to ensure compatibility with Tableau.

### 3. Tableau Visualization:
- Developed an understanding of Tableau's interface and data import process.
- Learned how to create different types of visualizations (e.g., bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, maps) to represent data effectively.
- Gained experience in designing a dynamic, interactive dashboard, adding filters to enable user customization.
- Explored Tableau features such as calculated fields, parameters, and aggregations for deeper data analysis.

### 4. Data Integration:
- Mastered the process of integrating data from different sources (SQL, Excel) into Tableau for analysis.
- Understood the importance of data cleanliness and structure when performing data visualization.

### 5. User Experience and Interaction:
- Focused on creating a dashboard that is not only informative but also interactive and easy to navigate for end-users.
- The dynamic filtering based on dropdown selection improved the usability and interactivity of the dashboard.

## Conclusion:
This project provided me with valuable hands-on experience in working with SQL for database management and Tableau for data visualization. I gained practical knowledge in data manipulation, extraction, and visualization, along with an understanding of how to create interactive dashboards that allow users to explore the data. The project enhanced my skills in SQL, Excel, and Tableau, while also improving my ability to design user-friendly data products.
